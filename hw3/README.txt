Dear hocam,

I accidentally made the package name homework2 instead of homework3, since this is our second programming assignment.

So when you are running the code, please run it like java homework2.TestClassBlaBla. Sorry for the inconvenience.


How To Compile And Run:

Go to the related directory  ( cse222_hw3_a for ArrayList
			        cse222_hw3_b for LinkedList	
			        cse222_hw3_c for LDLinkedList )
			      
Go into src->homework2	
compile the .java files 	   ->      javac *java
change directory one level below ->       cd ..		
run the Test Class you desire    ->       java homework2.TestClassX   (substitute X for 1,2,3 or 4).


You can also find the "javadoc" and the "report" in the related directories. 



Thank you :)
